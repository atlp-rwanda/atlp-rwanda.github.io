        <p> From day one, the trainees learn by doing. The 22 weeks of the training program simulates a real world
            technology product setup, where they learn to work within a team to build web applications with best
            practices, based on Javascript and it’s associated frameworks. Top candidates who are able to make it
            through the training program successfully, are then officially regarded as Apprentice Developers. </p>

                            professional. When we onboarded the team of apprentices from Andela, they were tasked
                            with driving an
                            in-house project from start to finish. By the end of their apprenticeship period, they
                            had
                            completed the development of many of the system models. This project is now close to
                            completion and the pending works are being implemented by one of the apprentices that we
                            hired
                            full-time.

                    This service is provided free of charge by Andela. However, we require companies to provide stipend to
                    apprentices.
                </p>
                <p> You will also be contributing to the development of technical talent on the African continent. Each
                    developer is expected to stay on
                    your team for at least <span class="highlight"> 12 weeks</span> after which you can either
                    hire them or they roll off your team and we will recommend other full time opportunities for them. </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>Who are Andela Apprentices, what skills do they possess?</summary>
            <hr>
            <p > They are talented developers who’ve undergone intensive training in the PERN(PosgreSQL & MongoDB,
                Express. React, Node) software stack. As well as an immersive, experiential process of learning the soft
                skills required to thrive as a professional in any distributed engineering team. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Ok, but can I hire them directly if I like their work?</summary>
            <p> Of course! Once the 12 weeks period from when they start working with you is up, you can go on ahead to
                hire them immediately. If you’d like to hire sooner, and prefer not to continue the “3 month trial”,
                that’s also possible! </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What support do I get from Andela?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li> Performance management. We provide a strong and tight feedback loop between the Apprentice and your
                    Engineering manager/lead to make sure they’re fully aware of your expectations from them and act
                    accordingly. </li>

                <li> We hold monthly technical workshops as well as coaching sessions, to make sure we’re able to impart
                    them with more knowledge than they’re potentially exposed to on their engagements. Armed with such
                    knowledge, they become more of an asset on your team. </li>
            </ul>

            <summary>What’s the difference between Andela and the Andela Technical Leadership Program?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li> Good question. Andela here refers to the company you know and love whose mission is to distribute
                    as many available opportunities to all available talent, world wide. Specifically, to achieve this
                    as a global company, we plan to create infrastructure that ensures we’re able to place the right
                    talent at the right time for as many companies that need such talent. </li>
                <li> However, Andela Rwanda has a responsibility to implement this mission by sourcing talent from
                    within Africa and train them to become job ready developers. <a id="cta-visit-atlp-page"
                        href="https://andela.com/engineers/technical-leadership-program-rwanda/" target="_blank"> The
                        Andela Technical Leadership Program</a> (ATLP) is the
                    vehicle with which Andela
                    Rwanda is making
                    that happen.</li>
