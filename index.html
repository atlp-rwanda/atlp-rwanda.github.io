            technology product setup, where they learn to work within a team to build world class software with best
            practices, based on Javascript and it’s associated frameworks. Top candidates who are able to make it
            through the training program successfully, are then officially regarded as Apprentice Engineers. </p> <img

        <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
        <details>
            <summary>Who are Andela Apprentices, what skills do they possess?</summary>
            <p> They are talented engineers who’ve undergone intensive training in the PERN(PosgreSQL & MongoDB,
                Express. React, Node) software stack. As well as an immersive, experiential process of learning the soft
                skills required to thrive as a professional in any distributed engineering team. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How much does it cost to hire Andela Apprentices?</summary>
            <p> $0. Yes, absolutely nothing! It’s a win win. You get to try awesome engineering talent for free within a
                3 month period and you can decide to hire them full time once they've proven to add value to your team.
                On our end, we get to continue upskilling the Apprentices until we believe they’re totally ready to join
                the job ecosystem. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How long would they be available to me for free?</summary>
            <p> For a period of 3 months after they start working with you. Afterwards, you have to either hire them or
                let them roll off your team gracefully. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Ok, but can I hire them directly if I like their work?</summary>
            <p> Of course! Once the 3 month period from when they start working with you is up, you can go on ahead to
                hire them immediately. If you’d like to hire sooner, and prefer not to continue the “3 month trial”,
                that’s also possible! </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What support do I get from Andela when I hire these Apprentices?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li> Performance management. We provide a strong and tight feedback loop between the Apprentice and your
                    Engineering manager/lead to make sure they’re fully aware of your expectations from them and act
                    accordingly. </li>
                <li> If it so happens that after weeks of feedback, you’re still unhappy with a particular Apprentice’s
                    performance, we roll them off your team and replace them at your request. </li>
                <li> We hold monthly technical workshops as well as coaching sessions, to make sure we’re able to impart
                    them with more knowledge than they’re potentially exposed to on their engagements. Armed with such
                    knowledge, they become more of an asset on your team, as they’re able to bring fresh ideas to old
                    and new challenges alike. </li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What’s the difference between Andela and the Andela Technical Leadership Program?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li> Good question. Andela here refers to the company you know and love whose mission is to distribute
                    as many available opportunities to all available talent, world wide. Specifically, to achieve this
                    as a global company, we plan to create infrastructure that ensures we’re able to place the right
                    talent at the right time for as many companies that need such talent. </li>
                <li> However, Andela Rwanda has a responsibility to implement this mission by sourcing talent from
                    within Africa and train them to become world class junior engineers. </li>
                <li> The Andela Technical Leadership Program(ATLP) is the vehicle with which Andela Rwanda is making
                    that happen. It consists of a 5 month intensive technical and soft skills training, a 3 month
                    Apprenticeship with a reputable tech company and a 2 week career coaching program. </li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Love this! Can I send potential employees to Andela to train them before I employ them?</summary>
            <p> We like how you think! Right now, we don’t train for specific competencies on request, you’d simply have
                to refer them to apply to the program, and we can arrange for them to Apprentice with your company.
                However, watch this space for more interesting developments around this! </p>
